# hunt_random
For those, who doesn't know what skin to play in Hunt: Showdown.
In the file "main/skins.txt" type name of skin and it's weight separated by coma all with new line --> "redshirt,3".
It already has some skins for example.
Then just run "choose_skin.exe" file and you will see the name of skin in console.
Have a nice one!
